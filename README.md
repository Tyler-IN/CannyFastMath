# CannyFastMath

Faster implementations of various common math operations,
and harmless placeholders for math operations that just
forward to the originals.

## Why would you need this?

You don't, it's just a nice to have.

## Differences
Current differences with .NET Core Math functions:
 * Round with no MidpointRounding specified rounds away from zero instead of to nearest even integer.
